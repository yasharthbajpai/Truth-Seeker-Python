CLAIM: virat kohli is better captian than ms dhonin?

VERDICT: Partially True

EXPLANATION:
Based on the available statistics and records, it's not entirely accurate to state that Virat Kohli is definitively a better captain than MS Dhoni. Both have excelled in different areas of captaincy, making a clear-cut comparison difficult. Here's a breakdown:

1. Test Cricket: Kohli has a better record in Tests, with a win percentage of 58.82% compared to Dhoni's 45.00%. Kohli led India in 68 Test matches, winning 40, while Dhoni captained in 60 Tests, winning 27.

2. ODI Cricket: Kohli has a higher win percentage in ODIs (70.43% from 95 matches) compared to Dhoni (55.00% from 200 matches). However, Dhoni led India to victory in two major ICC trophies - the 2011 World Cup and the 2013 Champions Trophy.

3. T20I Cricket: Dhoni has a slightly lower win percentage (56.94% from 72 matches) compared to Kohli (60.00% from 50 matches). However, Dhoni led India to victory in the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007.

4. IPL: Dhoni has been significantly more successful in the IPL, leading Chennai Super Kings to 4 titles, while Kohli has not won an IPL title as captain.

5. Overall Impact: Dhoni is often credited with changing the phase of Indian cricket and is considered one of the most successful captains in Indian cricket history. Kohli, on the other hand, is recognized for his aggressive approach and for making India a dominant force in Test cricket, especially in overseas conditions.

CORRECTIONS:
The statement "Virat Kohli is a better captain than MS Dhoni" is an oversimplification. While Kohli has better statistical records in some formats, Dhoni's success in ICC tournaments and the IPL, along with his overall impact on Indian cricket, makes it difficult to definitively state that one is better than the other. Both captains have their unique strengths and have contributed significantly to Indian cricket in different ways.
